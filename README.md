# Initial_Pressure
This Matlab function run simple calculations of a pressure model. The goal is to determine the initial pressure needed for a cylinder to support the force of someone stepping on it. It also calculates the stiffness associated with the pressure and cross section area of the modeled cylinder. This is part of the robotic shoe project
